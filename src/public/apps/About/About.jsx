                    Iâ€™m a software engineer, and I specialize in back-end architecture and web application development. I have wide range of skills ranging from CI/CD, infrastructure, to web applications. I am a life-long learner, and I enjoy utilizing software to solving complex problems and expressing my creativity through my work.
                    Originally from Phoenix, Arizona, I graduated from the University of San Diego, and I never left the area. I enjoy walking around my bustling neighborhood. When the weather is good on the weekends, you can find me walking through the many San Diego parks.
